<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>In Singapore's vibrant housing market, the resale sector of the Housing and Development Board (HDB) plays a pivotal role in meeting the diverse needs of residents. However, navigating this market landscape presents a formidable challenge, characterised by the intricate interplay of myriad factors influencing resale prices. Amidst this complexity, there exists a pressing need to <span>leverage advanced analytical techniques to unravel the underlying dynamics and provide stakeholders with the insights necessary to make informed decisions</span>.</p> 
<br>
<p>Driven by the imperative to enhance market transparency and facilitate fair transactions, this project seeks to harness the power of machine learning and feature engineering to analyse and predict HDB resale prices accurately. By delving into the multifaceted factors shaping resale prices, we aim to develop robust predictive models that empower stakeholders with the foresight needed to navigate the market landscape confidently. Through this endeavour, we aspire to contribute to the evolution of a more transparent, efficient, and equitable housing ecosystem in Singapore.</p>
